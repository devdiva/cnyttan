## Roadmap

### Pre-Alpha

The goals of pre-alpha are to articulate the design
and structure of the application.

Key goals and considerations are:

* Portable to multiple usages, across devices
* Possibly embeddable as a utility in other sites
* Humans[1] should find the experience useful, fun and inspiring

_[1]: Robots, entities and androids should also find the tool useful and inspiring.  Their experience of fun may depend on the parameters of their programming._

__Milestone 0__

* [ ] Initial design and specifications
* [ ] Initial visual language and design direction

__Milestone 1__

A proof-of-concept command line interface will be 
created to execute and test basic functions.

- [ ] Input/select project type
- [ ] Input/select project method
- [ ] Input/select needle size
- [ ] Input/select needle type
- [ ] Estimate number of stitches (gauge)
- [ ] Estimate yarn length
- [ ] Output results

__Milestone 2__

A proof-of-concept to demonstrate portability goals.
Representtions will be largely text-based, perhaps with
iconic visual imagery.

- [ ] CLI usable on mac, linux, windows or serverless
- [ ] web site
- [ ] embeddable
- [ ] hybrid app
- [ ] native app

__Milestone 3__

Useable output formats.

- [ ] Instructions and pattern

__Milestone 4__

A proof-of-concept to demonstrate visualization and detail
the design language.

- [ ] Design system
- [ ] 2D symbols, iconography or fonts
- [ ] UI/GUI libraries
- [ ] 2D visualizaiton proof
- [ ] 3D models
- [ ] 3D visualizaiton proof

__Milestone 5__

A proof-of-concept to demonstrate learning, simulation, 
recommednation or similar features applicable to this space.

### Alpha

- [ ] 2D reference implementation
- [ ] 3D reference implementation

### Beta..Release

Goals and criteria to be defined after pre-alpha explorations.


### Editions

Editions allow for the further exploration of the concepts in 
different directions or reusing hte core logic in other novel 
or newly envisioned scenarios.

Ideas:

* Exploration of historical, anthropological examples
* Cross-disciplinary exploration health or neurological benefit


## Development

So far, I know it will be written with Rust and target both 
cross platform apps and WebAssembly.
